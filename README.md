## 🌟 About The Project

This tool is designed for developers who need to automate the iOS app export process. Instead of dealing with the complex Xcode GUI every time, you can now run a simple terminal command to quickly export your apps, whether for development, Ad-Hoc testing, or App Store submission.

## ⚡ Key Features

-   🔹 **Batch Processing:** Export multiple `.xcarchive` files at once.
-   🎨 **Rich & Interactive UI:** A beautiful and informative terminal output with colors, spinners, and progress bars.
-   ⏱ **Time Tracking:** Accurately calculates and displays the duration for each export task.
-   ⚙️ **Fully Customizable:** Choose the export method that suits your needs (`development`, `ad-hoc`, `app-store`, `enterprise`).
-   📁 **Automatic Organization:** Each exported `.ipa` is saved in its own dedicated folder to keep things tidy.
-   📜 **Clear Logging:** `xcodebuild` logs are streamed directly to your terminal for easy debugging.
